# The-Tech-Academy-Basic-C-Sharp-Projects
This folder is an assembly of exercises and prjects I did throughout the course. As you can see there were quite a few titles that were labeled referencing simple drills to grasp one particular topic in the C# language. Below I will label and highlight some of the more involved projects but feel free to take a look through everything you'd like.

Key Projects:

Car Insurance

This project was built using and MVC web application in order to quickly mimic a car insurance website. The focus of this project was to explore the different functionalities of a MVC as well as utilize business logic to calculate casualty quotes for users. The project takes a user's information to underwriting guidelines programed into the project and produces an auto quote for the user's unique answers to the questions. This project also features and Admin view that permits the staff to see an overview of all of the quotes issued by the system.
