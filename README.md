# The-Tech-Academy-Basic-C-Sharp-Projects
This folder is an assembly of exercises and prjects I did throughout the course. As you can see there were quite a few titles that were labeled referencing simple drills to grasp one particular topic in the C# language. Many of the exercises were build as console applications. Below I will label and highlight some of the more involved projects but feel free to take a look through everything you'd like.

Key Projects:

Car Insurance

This project was built using and MVC web application in order to quickly mimic a car insurance website. The focus of this project was to explore the different functionalities of a MVC as well as utilize business logic to calculate casualty quotes for users. The project takes a user's information to underwriting guidelines programed into the project and produces an auto quote for the user's unique answers to the questions. This project also features and Admin view that permits the staff to see an overview of all of the quotes issued by the system. 

CodeFirst Entity Framework Project

This project was another one that was used to gain exposure to how to use logic to add and remove students from a list of active students at the made up institution. I found this project to be a useful stepping stone in problem solving and figuring out different functionalities and applying them on the job. This project involved a lot of independent online research through a plethera of information to put all of the pieces together.
